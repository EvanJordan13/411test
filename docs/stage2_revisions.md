We made a few changes to the UML diagram to address the comments we received for our Stage 2 submission.

First, we removed the foreign key labels from the diagram as suggested by the feedback.

Second, we stopped representing player news and favorites as entities and instead represent their respective many to many relationships as lines between their corresponding entities.
